#### {New York Flights Exercise}

To explore the basic data manipulation verbs of dplyr, we'll start with the built-in textit{nycflights13} data frame. This dataset comes from the US Bureau of Transporation Statistics contains information on flights that departed from New York City in 2013. 


<pre>
<code>
library(dplyr) # for functions
library(nycflights13) # for data
data(flights)
</code>
</pre>
<p>

####  * {Preliminary Exercises}
Using simple data inspection functions, answer the following questions. %MAM: Do you mean using simple dplyr inspection functions or any? I would actually list the functions that should be used  in the question.

 * How many columns (i.e. variables) are there in this data set?
 * How many rows (i.e. cases) are there?
 * Which column has the most missing values?
 * What are names of the last three variables?
 * What type of data object is ``flights"?


<pre>
<code>
#> year month day dep_time dep_delay arr_time arr_delay carrier tailnum
#> 1  2013  115172830  11UA  N14228
#> 2  2013  115334850  20UA  N24211
#> 3  2013  115422923  33AA  N619AA
#> 4  2013  11544  -1  1004 -18B6  N804JB
#> ..  ...... ...... ...... ...  ...  ...
</code>
</pre>

#### {Converting to tbl}
% MAM: Note that the flights data set is already tbl 
The dataset flights is of class ***tbl_df}, which is a wrapper around a data frame. ***tbl_df} prevents the€™ accidental printing of large dataset to the screen. While textbf{dplyr} can work with data frames as is, if you're dealing with large data it'€™s worth converting them to a ***tbl_df} using the function ***as.tbl()}.



%=================================================================================== %
<p>
#### {Filter rows with ***filter()}}

***filter()} allows you to select a subset of the rows of a data frame. The first argument is the name of the data frame, and the second and subsequent are filtering expressions evaluated in the context of that data frame:
For example, we can select all flights on January 1st (New Years Day) with:

<pre>
<code>
> flightsNYD = filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
> dim(flightsNYD)
[1] 842  16
</code>
</pre>
<p>



<p>
#### { ***group_by()}}

The ***tbl} also comes in a grouped variant which allows you to easily perform operations ``by group". Suppose we wish to group by carrier.

<pre>
<code>
> carriersDF  <- group_by(flights, carrier)
</code>
</pre>
<p>

What type of object is ***carriersDF}? (multiple answers)

<pre>
<code>
> by_tailnum <- group_by(flights, tailnum)
> delay <- summarise(by_tailnum,
count = n(), 
dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
> delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dist < 2000)
</code>
</pre>
<p>

%======================================================================================================== %
<p>
### {Weather data set}

 * ***origin}: Weather station. Named origin to facilitate merging with flights data
 * ***year,month,day,hour}: Time of recording
 * ***temp,dewp}: Temperature and dewpoint in F
 * ***humid}: Relative humidity
 * ***wind_dir,wind_speed,wind_gust}: Wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph)
 * ***precip}: Precipitation, in inches
 * ***pressure}: Sea level pressure in millibars
 * ***visib}: Visibility in miles
