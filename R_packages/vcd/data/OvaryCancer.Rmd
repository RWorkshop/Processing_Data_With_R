was obtained from 299 women, who were operated for ovary cancer 10 years before.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

data("OvaryCancer")

#### Format 

A data frame with 16 observations and 5 variables.
Freq frequency.
stage factor indicating the stage of the cancer at the time of operation (early, advanced).
operation factor indicating type of operation (radical, limited).
survival factor indicating survival status after 10 years (yes, no).
xray factor indicating whether X-ray treatment was received (yes, no).

#### Examples
```{r}

data("OvaryCancer")
tab <- xtabs(Freq ~ xray + survival + stage + operation, data = OvaryCancer)
ftable(tab, col.vars = "survival", row.vars = c("stage", "operation", "xray"))
## model: ~ xray * operation * stage + survival * stage
## interpretation: treat xray, operation, stage as fixed margins,
## the survival depends on stage, but not xray and operation.
doubledecker(survival ~ stage + operation + xray, data = tab)
mosaic(~ stage + operation + xray + survival,
split = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), data = tab, keep = FALSE,
gp = gpar(fill = rev(grey.colors(2))))
mosaic(~ stage + operation + xray + survival,
split = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), data = tab, keep = FALSE,
