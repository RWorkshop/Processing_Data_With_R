Kappa Cohen's Kappa and Weighted Kappa

#### Desription

Computes two agreement rates: Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa, and confidence bands.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

Kappa(x, weights = c("Equal-Spacing", "Fleiss-Cohen"))
## S3 method for class 'Kappa'
print(x, digits=max(getOption("digits") - 3, 3), CI=FALSE, level=0.95, ...)
## S3 method for class 'Kappa'
confint(object, parm, level = 0.95, ...)
## S3 method for class 'Kappa'
summary(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'summary.Kappa'
print(x, ...)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* ``x`` For Kappa: a confusion matrix. For the print methods: object of class "Kappa" or "summary.Kappa"
* ``weights`` either one of the character strings given in the default value, or a user-specified matrix with same dimensions as x.
* ``digits`` minimal number of significant digits.
* CI logical; shall confidence limits be added to the output?
* `` level`` : confidence level between 0 and 1 used for the confidence interval.
* ``object``: object of class "Kappa".
* ``parm``: Currently, ignored.
* ``...``: Further arguments passed to the default print method.



#### Examples
```{r}

data("SexualFun")
K <- Kappa(SexualFun)
K
confint(K)
summary(K)
print(K, CI = TRUE)
```
#### Details
Cohen's kappa is the diagonal sum of the (possibly weighted) relative frequencies, corrected for
expected  Value 
 and standardized by its maximum value. The equal-spacing weights are defined by
1????ji????jj=(r????1), r number of columns/rows, and the Fleiss-Cohen weights by 1????ji????jj2=(r????1)2.
The latter one attaches greater importance to near disagreements.


#### Value
An object of class "Kappa" with three components:
* Unweighted numeric vector of length 2 with the kappa statistic (value component), along with Approximate Standard Error (ASE component)
* Weighted idem for the weighted kappa.
* Weights numeric matrix with weights used.

#### Note
The summary method also prints the weights.
There is a confint method for computing approximate confidence intervals.
