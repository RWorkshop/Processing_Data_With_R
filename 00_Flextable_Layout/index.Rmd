We expect to present talks pertaining to

* Data Science and Machine Learning
* Big Data and Data Engineering
* Software Engineering and Development Operations
* Web Frameworks (i.e. Django)
* IOT, Sensors and Micropython

Abstracts for Morning Session 1

### Room 1

<h5>GraphQL with Python </h5>


* The talk will be about GraphQL technology. What is GraphQL and why we might use it. 
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GraphQL. 
* I will talk about the main concepts in GraphQL like schemas, types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
* I will show how to implement GraphQL with python using an example with Graphene and Django. 
* I will have a demo with a sample app build in Django that will serve as a GraphQL API.



### Room 2






<h5> Social Network Analysis of the 1916 rising (James Nagle)</h5>

In 2015 the National Archives released files which had been compiled by the Dublin Metropolitan Police 100 years beforehand. From June 1915 to April 1916 they followed members of groups such as Sinn F?in, the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League and reported on who they were seen talking to. Using these files, the python library networkX and the open source network analysis package Gephi, I was able to build a social network of the interactions recorded.

The resulting network supports well known facts about the planning around the 1916 Rising but also presents interesting questions surrounding figures who are rarely mentioned in Irish history but feature prominently in the network. During the reporting on these files at the time of their release these figures were overlooked as their importance could not be seen by a cursory glance. The network can also be used to understand what type of information the D.M.P. had in relation to the separatist movement and judge the effectiveness of their intelligence gathering.

This talk would serve as an introduction to social network analysis in python and the use of the networkX library and Gephi. If there is already a talk on this area I could discuss the use of data science in the study of Irish history. I have also applied natural language processing to the Anglo Irish Treaty debates and am currently looking at how python can be used to analyse the police books containing all arrests made by the DMP from 1905-1918.

All these projects focus on taking large, inaccessible data sets, presenting and visualising them in interesting and informative ways and extracting valuable findings from them. Some findings and visualisations of the 1916 network can be found here: http://www.anquantarbuile.com/social-network-of-the-1916-rising and the Anglo Irish Treaty debate project can be found here: http://www.anquantarbuile.com/treaty-debates

### Room 3

<h5>Building smarter solutions with no expertise in machine learning (Laurent Picard)</h5>


* ML? API? AutoML? Python is the language of choice to solve problems with machine learning, but what can we build in only a few hours or days and without any expertise? 

* In this session, we'll see how to benefit from existing ML models and how to create a custom model with AutoML techniques. 

* We'll also be active players of a live demo, so don't put your smartphone on airplane mode!

<h5> Working with PDF Documents </h5>

Bias Engineering is the tendency of people to engineer their own implicit biases into the products they create. And it could also be the effort to reduce these implicit biases in developed products.

I had been looking in particular at the Dunning-Kruger effect and how it pertains to software development.

One of the great advantages of both tools is their inherent customisability and extensibility: not only can you customise the output of the tools, be that HTML, LaTeX or something else, but you can also write extensions that allow you to do things up to and including automatically generating documentation for you.

<h5> Discriminative Machine Learning models for semantifying IoT data (Chidubem Iddianozie) </h5>

Discriminative Machine Learning models for semantifying IoT data: Why, How and Lessons Learnt.

This talk will focus on adding data visualization to Flask applications by using the amazing React Victory library.
Presenting data in web applications can be a daunting task, web applications make it very easy to store large amounts of data into your database of choice but many applications struggle with finding a way to display this data in a meaningful way. Server side rendering of charts can work but often lead to a slower and poor user experience.
This talk proposes a solution by integrating a React frontend onto your Flask application, and taking advantage of the powerful and flexible React Victory library for data charting and visualization.

Abstracts for Afternoon Session 1

### Room 1

<h5> I Want To Know What You Did Last Summer (Miguel Grinberg) </h5> 
We all love to learn about the cool things others make, but we tend to think those who write or talk publicly about their projects are rare and specially gifted individuals, while in fact they are normal people just like you and I. 
<hline>

<h5> High-Level APIs for Machine Learning (Iain Keaney) </h5>

* An introduction to the python high-level APIs for machine learning, that allow coders to get started on building and deploying models much quicker without knowing the mathematics behind machine learning. 
* May also discuss deployment in both cloud and/or edge.

### Room 2

<h5> Writing Good Python Code (Prashant Chaubey)</h5>

We love python because of its readability, massive ecosystem, vibrant community etc. and the list goes on. However, like other programming languages, it is easy to write cryptic, unmaintainable, and rigid python code. In short an ugly code(I can give an example). Moreover in teams, this problem escalates as different developers have diverse code styles. How to ensure code quality and homogeneity? PEP 8 is a style guide of python code.



### Room 3

<h5>Python for Social Good (Arjumand Younus)</h5>

As a data scientist, I am into making meaning from data and Python is the main tool for it.

However does this meaning translate into impact; and how can we come up with projects that provide huge societal impact.

I will delve into some example projects of my own while also giving examples of how Python helped with quick analysis.

This talk will be different from your traditional Python talks because of the interactive nature while we try to think of "Data Science for Social Good" projects.

Abstracts for Afternoon Session 2

### Room 1

<h5>Customer churn prediction and segmentation techniques	(Matteo Perrico)</h5>

My project tries to address a common problem in the field of supermarkets and retail: customer churn.

The work provides some ideas and developments to deal with this problem effectively.  The project was conducted on four supermarkets in Italy, considering the sales figures for 2018.

The work is developed in two main parts:

* the first part analyzes some customer segmentation techniques present in the literature, with the aim of developing a customized model to identify the customer churn. 

* The second part is the concrete application of the model of created, analysis of results and implementation of some predictive models to apply customer loyalty techniques.

The developed model is the result of some customizations of the basic RFM model. 

The goal is to interpret the behavior of customers, trying toindentify the significant changes over time.






<h5> Reproducible data science and scientific computing (Tania Allard) </h5>
Reproducible data science and scientific computing: how the open source ecosystem can help



### Room 2

<h5> Playing Pong with AI	(Meghana Rathi) </h5>


My project was based on using reinforcement learning specifically Q-learning and model predictive control to develop an agent that can play the atari game of PONG. 




### Room 3



<h5> Emotional demands of software development	(Jaime Buelta) </h5>

* A not talked too much part of being software developer is to handle the emotional and psychological demands of the work. 
* The pressure is high, and imposter syndrome cramps up. 
* In this talk we will talk about difficulties in handling the work and learn how to handle our emotions and fears is an important ability in a long career.	


<h5>Build a customizable Flask application (Domas Zelionis)</h5>

The talk will feature:

* A live coding demonstration of the project setup.

* Enable authentication, including user roles and privileges.
* Overview of setting up your MongoDB and database connections.
* Customization and styling for your project.
