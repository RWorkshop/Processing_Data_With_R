\section{Time and Dates}
\begin{itemize}\item The builtin
\texttt{as.Date()} function handles dates (without times);\item the contributed package
\texttt{chron} handles dates and times, but does not control for time zones; \item
\texttt{POSIXct} and \texttt{POSIXlt} classes allow for dates and times with control for time
zones.
\end{itemize}
